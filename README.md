learning the ropes

My passion is turning data into understanding to guide decision-making in both research and business. I am exploring internships and careers in data management and analysis, statistical programming, study design, and business analytics. I have experience reviewing scientific literature, performing laboratory benchwork, and manipulating data in SAS, R, and Microsoft Excel.
In my spare time I enjoy reading and writing about bioethics topics, especially about the intersection of new technology and public policy.
